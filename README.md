# I-and-I-research
Summer research project investigating wastewater infrastructure data in Kutztown, PA

This was a KU Bears research project for the Summer 2021 under the supervision of 
Dr. Brooks Emerick of the Kutztown University Department of Mathematics.
Our goal was to gain a better understanding of an infrastructure issue in the Borough 
of Kutztown. Inflow and Infiltration ('I & I') refer to two categories of situations where 
rainwater is entering the wastewater system; the processing of this rainwater at the
wastewater treatment plant results in added costs through wasted energy and other resources.

Previously, a group of students had confirmed that Inflow and Infiltration
are adding significant costs to the yearly budget. It was our purpose to expand
on their research and determine whether certain infrastructure repairs were in fact 
successful in terms of reducing the amount of I & I.

We obtained data from the Borough along with precipitation and other climate data.
Using Matlab, specifically its Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox, we used a 
combination of regression techniques and hypothesis tests to confirm that the repairs had 
in fact been successful. This research will be continued by a group of Kutztown 
University STEM students in Dr. Emerick's Mathematical Computing class.
